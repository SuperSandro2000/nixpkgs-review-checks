# nixpkgs-review-checks

Add additional checks and more information from build logs and outputs to the reports generated by [Mic92/nixpkgs-review](https://github.com/Mic92/nixpkgs-review/).

## Features

- Search through logs to find special keywords that indicate a common error like `Ran 0 tests in 0.000s` by pytest or stale substituteInPlace
- Sort build failures by failing on master and new failing via hydra-check
- Run nixpkgs-hammering, filter warnings and add them to the report
- Automatically upload logs on build failures to termbin
- Check binaries and shared objects for missing objects and left over debugging symbols
- Block the review shell from closing if there are unstaged changes in nixpkgs
- Filter empty reports and non usefull reports for certain people
